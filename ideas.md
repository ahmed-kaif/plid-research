1. Generate synthetic datas for other classes based on Macnab criterion so that class imbalance can be mitigated. Here we can use multiple methods for generating synthetic data like CTGAN, TAVE, BN, SEQ etc.
2. SHAP graphs for explainable AI value for reliability of our models.
3. check other gradient boosting model like XGBoost

## Measuring Diversity
1. Extended Isolation Forest
